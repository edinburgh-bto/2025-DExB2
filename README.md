# DExB2-development

This repository is for all python workbook analysis for Data Exploration in Biology 2nd year course, at SBS in Edinburgh.

The DExB2-development repository is private, for the course team to access and update materials over the years.

Students have access to a different, curated, repository at https://github.com/edinburgh-bto/2025-DExB2

# 2025-DExB2

2025 delivery of Data Exploration in Biology 2nd year course, School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh.

This repository contains all notebooks (.ipynb), code, and datasets relevant to the course.

We plan to update the repository after each class with:

- the following class's notebooks
- any solutions for the previous class's notebooks

## How to use this

To load (or update) this repository on the Noteable server:

1. Login to Noteable, using the link on the [course Learn page](https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk/ultra/courses/_126808_1/outline) or via https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/launch
2. Open a Standard Notebook (Python 3)
3. **FIRST TIME ONLY** Go to the Git menu, click clone Git Repository and select URL: https://github.com/edinburgh-bto/2025-DExB2. This should create or update a folder called 2025-DExB2, that you can work in.
4. **OTHER TIMES** - first navigate to the 2025-DExB2 on your Noteable server. Go to the Git menu, click `Pull from Remote`, and it should update your local files. **NOTE CHECK THIS ON UPDATED NOTEBOOK**

Contact members of the course team for help.

## What to do if you get a Git error message

We recommend using Git `Pull from Remote` as described above. However, sometimes Git operations lead to erros.

If you "force" an update using `Pull from Remote (Force)`, then you could lose local changes that you've made to files.

You can avoid overwriting work by first making a local copy of the file with a different name, for example if you've been working on `Class_1.ipynb` then save a copy with your edits named, for example `Class_1_myworking_October3.ipynb`. If you have a copy with a different name it should be kept if you do a forced pull.

Similarly, it is possible to rename the directory to, for example `2025-DExB2_October3`, and then clone a fresh copy of `2025-DExB2`. Be careful though, because if you do this many times then you will have many copies and lose track of which is which.
