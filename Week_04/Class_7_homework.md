# Class 7 homework: do an example class test

Class 7 homework is an example class test involving plant transcription factor data.

You will find this in the folder `Example_Tests/ExampleTest_PlantTFs_paper.ipynb`

This test uses material that we have already covered on the course, except for the material on t-tests that we will cover in week 5.

*Tip: Where the example test says "upload to LEARN" - you don't have to do this for homework, that's just showing what the actual class test will ask.*
